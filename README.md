# Travel-Agency-Node

In this project, a web application has been developed for a travel agency, allowing the user to consult information on available trips, view and add reviews.

At the backend level it is developed using JavaScript under the NodeJS framework, it uses a MySQL database with which it communicates through Sequelize as ORM.

The interface is a vanilla frontend (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), built without frameworks and using PUG as a template engine.
